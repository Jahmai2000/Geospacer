<!--<h1> The Rooster of Change </h1>
<br>
<h2> The Beginnings </h>-->

<p> The Roosters were always indoctrinated by the teachings of the high
	priest "Yamaymeat", He always preached that chickens were more than
	foul, more than meat, more than... food. His teachings got him in trouble
	before with the humans and they threatened to cook him. However, the owner
	of the barner, Mr.Kenshiro, always look out for Yamaymeat as he is the 
	reason he even has the barn.</p>
	
<p>Yamaymeat allowed Mr.Kenshiro to aquire the farm by winning the best Rooster
	competion which granted him the rights to a farm. Yamaymeat dies'nt really
	have any ill intentions towards his owner, However he believes that he is
	still equally to blame for the enslavement system which is prevelant in his
	 bretherin society.</p>
